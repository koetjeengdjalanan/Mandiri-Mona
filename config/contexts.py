    Context manager for setting up and managing a logging system with queue-based handling.

    This context manager initializes a QueueListener for handling log records from a queue,
    starts the listener, yields it for use within the context, and ensures proper cleanup
    by stopping the listener when the context exits.

    Args:
        settings (LoggingSettings): Configuration settings for the logging system.
        console (Console): Console object for output handling (likely from rich library).
        log_queue (Queue, optional): Queue for collecting log records. Defaults to an
            unbounded Queue (maxsize=-1).
        level (Literal["DEBUG", "INFO", "WARNING", "ERROR", "CRITICAL"], optional):
            Logging level threshold. Defaults to "INFO".

    Yields:
        QueueListener: The active queue listener instance that processes log records
            from the queue.

    Example:
        >>> with logging_context(settings, console) as listener:
        ...     # Logging operations happen here
        ...     logger.info("Message will be processed by the listener")
